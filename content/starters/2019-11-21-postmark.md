## Variations

Each template comes in three layout variations: Basic, Basic full, and Plain. 
This gives you a starting point to customize them to match your brand.

## Dark Mode

The templates support dark mode where available.

There's also a `dark` Tailwind CSS screen utility:

```js
dark: {'raw': '(prefers-color-scheme: dark)'},
``` 

This makes it easy to change element styles bassed on user's settings.

## Customization

The Starter defines a `company` object in `config.js`, so that you can update company info in one place:

```js
module.exports = {
  company: {
    name: '[Company Name, LLC]',
    address: `
    <br>1234 Street Rd.
    <br>Suite 1234
    `,
    product: '[Product Name]',
    sender: '[Sender Name]',
  },
  // ...
}
```

Need to preserve the `{{ }}` curly braces for Postmark variables?

Use the `{% raw %}` tag:

```
{% raw %}{{action_url}}{% endraw %}
```
