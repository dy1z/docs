## Templates

The following templates are included:

- Accordion
- Carousel

## Customization

A few notes on customizing this Starter.

### Tailwind CSS

AMP templates don't allow inline CSS, so we've set `important: false` in `tailwind.config.js`. 
Because of this, the starter also uses an `md` screen and a mobile-first approach, instead of the usual desktop-first.

### AMP Components

For each component that you want to use in a template, you need to add its script to the `<head>`. 
We do this with a `head` block, right in the Template:

```html
{% extends "src/layouts/default.njk" %}

{% block head %}
<script async custom-element="amp-accordion" src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-accordion-0.1.js"></script>
{% endblock %}
```
