### eCommerce HTML emails (30)

- Design system in Tailwind CSS config

## Compatibility

The templates are responsive and will render properly in the majority of email clients.

Whether your audience uses modern devices like the iPhone, or if you send to a business segment that opens your emails in Outlook, these emails will look great!

Render testing has been done with Email on Acid. To see all email clients that these templates have been tested in, checkout the [compatibility table](https://craftingemails.com/full-preview#compatibility).

## Updates

You get free updates forever. Buy once, get updates for the lifetime of the product.

## License

You can use these templates in an **unlimited number of projects**.

You cannot, however, sell templates that you create based on these templates, or create derivative component libraries, template builders, or any other type of product where the primary purpose is clearly to repackage and redistribute these templates.
