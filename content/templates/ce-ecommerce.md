Whether your audience uses modern devices like the iPhone, or if you send to a business segment that opens your emails in Outlook, these emails will look great!

Render testing has been done with Email on Acid. To see all email clients that these templates have been tested in, checkout the [compatibility table](https://craftingemails.com/full-preview#compatibility).

You cannot, however, sell templates that you create based on these templates, or create derivative component libraries, template builders, or any other type of product where the primary purpose is clearly to repackage and redistribute these templates.
