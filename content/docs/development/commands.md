# CLI commands in Maizzle

The CLI tool includes commands for scaffolding, developing, and building your emails.

## new

```sh
maizzle new [path] [repo]
```

The `new` command is used to scaffold and initialize a Maizzle project. 

It accepts two arguments, both optional:

| Argument | Type | Required | Default value | Description
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `[path]` | string | no |  maizzle | Directory name to create
| `[repo]` | string | no |  <div class="w-32 break-words"><span>https:&zwnj;//github.com/maizzle/maizzle</span></div> | Repository URL for a starter project

Running it with no arguments will:

1. Create a `maizzle` directory
2. Clone the `maizzle/maizzle` repo into it
3. Install the NPM dependencies

So you can basically clone any repo into any system path, which means you can use any starter project - not just ours - as long as you can clone it with Git.

  <div class="text-gray-600">If the <code class="shiki-inline">[path]</code> directory already exists, scaffolding will be aborted.</div>
</div>

## build

```sh
maizzle build [env]
```

`maizzle build` is used to compile your templates and output them to the destination directory. If `[env]` is specified, Maizzle will try to merge `config.[env].js` on top of the [default config](/docs/configuration/).

| Argument | Type | Required | Default value | Description
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `[env]` | string | no |  local | An environment name to use. This is the `[env]` inside your `config.[env].js` file name.

<div class="bg-gray-100 border-l-4 border-gradient-b-ocean-light p-4 mb-4 text-md" role="alert">
  <div class="text-gray-600">If no <code class="shiki-inline">[env]</code> is specified, Maizzle will only use <code class="shiki-inline">config.js</code>.</div>
</div>



## serve

```sh
maizzle serve
```

Use this command to develop emails locally.

A local development server is first created with BrowserSync, `maizzle build` is then called, and a directory listing is finally opened in your default browser. 

You can make changes to a file, save it, and have the browser automatically reload for you. And, of course, you can also [configure BrowserSync](/docs/browsersync/).

This command has the fastest build time, since most Transformers are disabled on purpose for local development, in the default `config.js`.

When developing locally, you have _all_ classes generated by Tailwind CSS at your disposal, so you can rapidly prototype and style emails, even right in the browser.
