# CLI commands

The CLI tool includes commands for scaffolding, developing, and building your emails.

## Scaffolding

CLI commands for creating new projects and scaffolding templates or configs.

### new

```sh
maizzle new [path?] [repo?] --no-deps?
```

The `new` command is used to scaffold and initialize a Maizzle project. 

It accepts two arguments, both optional:

| Argument | Type | Required | Default | Description
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `[path]` | string | no |  maizzle | Directory name to create project in
| `[repo]` | string | no |  <div class="w-32 break-words"><span>https:&zwnj;//github.com/maizzle/maizzle.git</span></div> | Git repository URL for a starter project

| Flag | Shorthand | Description
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--no-deps` | `-d` | Don't install NPM dependencies

Running it with no arguments will:

1. Create a `maizzle` directory
2. Clone the `maizzle/maizzle` repo into it
3. Install the NPM dependencies

So you can basically clone any repo into any system path, which means you can use any starter project - not just ours - as long as you can clone it with Git.

</div>

<div class="bg-gray-100 border-l-4 border-gradient-b-orange-dark p-4 mb-4 text-md" role="alert">
  <div class="text-gray-600"><code class="shiki-inline">[repo]</code> must be a valid Git repository URL (.git extension included).</div>
</div>

## Development

CLI commands for developing emails with Maizzle.

### serve

```sh
maizzle serve
```

Use this command to develop emails locally.

A local development server is first created with BrowserSync, `maizzle build` is then called, and a directory listing is finally opened in your default browser ([configurable](/docs/browsersync/#open)). 

You can make changes to a file, save it, and the browser will automatically reload to reflect changes. And, of course, you can also [configure BrowserSync](/docs/browsersync/).

This command has the fastest build time, since most Transformers are disabled on purpose for local development, in the base `config.js`.

When developing locally, you have _all_ classes generated by Tailwind CSS at your disposal, so you can rapidly prototype and style emails, even right in the browser.

### build

```sh
maizzle build [env?]
```

`maizzle build` is used to compile your templates and output them to the destination directory. If `[env]` is specified, Maizzle will try to merge `config.[env].js` on top of the [default config](/docs/configuration/).

| Argument | Type | Required | Default | Description
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `[env]` | string | no |  local | An environment name to use

<div class="bg-gray-100 border-l-4 border-gradient-b-ocean-light p-4 mb-4 text-md" role="alert">
  <div class="text-gray-600">If no <code class="shiki-inline">[env]</code> is specified, Maizzle will default to <code class="shiki-inline">local</code> and use <code class="shiki-inline">config.js</code>.</div>
</div>
