# CLI Commands

The CLI tool includes commands for scaffolding, developing, and building your emails.

## Development

CLI commands for developing HTML emails with Maizzle.

### serve

```sh
maizzle serve [env]
```

| Argument | Type | Required | Default | Description
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `[env]` | string | no |  `local` | An environment name to use

<alert>If no <code>[env]</code> is specified, Maizzle will default to <code>local</code> and use <code>config.js</code>.</alert>

Use this command to develop emails locally:

- a local development server is first created with Browsersync
- `maizzle build [env]` is then called to compile your templates

You can preview your templates by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in a browser.

You can edit a Template in your code editor, save it, and the browser will automatically refresh. This is done with [Browsersync](/docs/build-config/#browsersync), which you can fully configure.

When running this command without an `[env]` name, you have all classes generated by Tailwind CSS at your disposal - so you can rapidly prototype and style emails right in the browser.

Need to develop _production_-ready templates and watch for changes?

Just run:

```sh
maizzle serve production
```

... and Maizzle will use your `config.production.js` to compile, while _also_ watching files for changes.

Template rebuilds are fast: Maizzle will only re-compile _that_ Template, so changes are usually reflected in under a second.

When making changes to files that have a global impact however, like Layouts, Components, or your Tailwind config, Maizzle will rebuild _all_ Templates.

### build

```bash
maizzle build [env]
```

`maizzle build` is used to compile your templates and output them to the destination directory. If `[env]` is specified, Maizzle will try to compute an environment config by merging `config.[env].js` on top of the [default config](/docs/build-config/).

| Argument | Type | Required | Default | Description
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `[env]` | string | no |  `local` | An environment name to use

<alert>If no <code>[env]</code> is specified, Maizzle will default to <code>local</code> and use <code>config.js</code>.</alert>

## Scaffolding

CLI commands for creating new projects and scaffolding templates or configs.

### new

```bash
maizzle new
```

The `new` command is used to scaffold and initialize a Maizzle project.

Run it with no arguments and you are presented with an interactive prompt:

<img src="https://github.com/maizzle/cli/raw/master/preview.gif" alt="Maizzle interactive prompt" class="mb-4">

Alternatively, you can add those arguments manually.

```bash
maizzle new <starter> [path] --no-deps?
```

As you can see, the arguments are similar to those in the `git clone` command.

| Argument | Required | Description
| --- | --- | --- |
| `starter` | Yes | Starter name or a Git repository URL.
| `path` | No | Directory path to create the project into.

The `--no-deps` flag can be used to skip installing NPM dependencies:

| Flag | Shorthand | Description
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--no-deps` | `-d` | Don't install NPM dependencies.

So you can basically clone any repo into any system path, which means you can use any starter project - not just ours - as long as you can clone it with Git.

Use one of the [original starters](/starters/):

```bash
maizzle new amp4email
```

Create from any GitHub repo:

```bash
maizzle new user/repo
```

Create from any Git repo:

```bash
maizzle new https://example.com/some-repo.git
```

Use a custom folder name:

```bash
maizzle new maizzle/starter-litmus folder-name
```

<alert>If the <code>[path]</code> directory already exists, scaffolding will be aborted.</alert>

<alert type="warning"><code>[repo]</code> must be a valid Git repository URL (.git extension included).</alert>

### make:config

```bash
maizzle make:config [env] --full?
```

Scaffolds a new `config.[env].js` in the project root.

Simply running `maizzle make:config` will bring up an interactive prompt:

<div class="pt-4 pb-2 mb-4" style="background: #272e3e">

  ![maizzle make:config](https://res.cloudinary.com/maizzle/image/upload/v1587730799/docs/make-config.gif)

</div>

Of course, you can skip the prompt by passing in arguments:

```bash
maizzle make:config [env] --full?
```

| Argument | Description
| --- | --- |
| `[env]` | Environment name to use for the config.

| Option | Shorthand | Description
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--full` | `-f` |  Scaffold a full config.

The `[env]` argument is an environment name, i.e. `staging`.

For example, let's scaffold `config.staging.js`:

```bash
maizzle make:config staging
```

By default, a minimal config is output:

```js
module.exports = {
  build: {
    templates: {
      destination: {
        path: 'build_local'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you want a full config, use the `--full` option:

```bash
maizzle make:config staging --full
```

### make:layout

```bash
maizzle make:layout
```

Scaffolds a new Layout based on the [Starter's default Layout](https://github.com/maizzle/maizzle/blob/master/src/layouts/main.html).

Running it with no arguments will present an interactive prompt:

<div class="pt-4 pb-2 mb-4" style="background: #272e3e">

  ![maizzle make:layout](https://res.cloudinary.com/maizzle/image/upload/v1587731659/docs/make-layout.gif)

</div>

You can skip the prompt by passing in arguments:

| Argument | Description
| --- | --- |
| `filename` | Name of the file to create, including extension, i.e. `layout.html`

| Option | Shorthand | Description
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--directory` | `-d` |  Directory where Layout file should be output.

<alert>If the <code>--directory</code> path does not exist, it will be created.</alert>

<alert type="warning">If the resulting file already exists, Layout scaffolding will be aborted and an error will be thrown. The file will not be overwritten.</alert>

Examples:

```bash
# scaffold a Layout in src/layouts
maizzle make:layout my-layout.html

# use a custom directory
maizzle make:layout amp-layout.html --directory=src/layouts/amp

# the above is the same as
maizzle make:layout amp-layout.html -d=src/layouts/amp

# paths can be relative to project root, i.e. one level above
maizzle make:layout main.html -d=../global-layouts
```

### make:template

```bash
maizzle make:template
```

Scaffolds a new Template.

Running it with no arguments will present an interactive prompt:

<div class="pt-4 pb-2 mb-4" style="background: #272e3e">

  ![maizzle make:template](https://res.cloudinary.com/maizzle/image/upload/v1587732393/docs/make-template.gif)

</div>

You can skip the prompt by passing in arguments:

| Argument | Description
| --- | --- |
| `filename` | Name of the file to create, including extension, i.e. `template.html`

| Option | Shorthand | Description
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--directory` | `-d` |  Directory where Template file should be output.

<alert>If the <code>--directory</code> path does not exist, it will be created.</alert>

<alert type="warning">If the resulting file already exists, Template scaffolding will be aborted and an error will be thrown. The file will not be overwritten.</alert>

Examples:

```bash
# scaffold a Template in src/templates
maizzle make:template my-template.html

# use a custom directory
maizzle make:template amp-template.html --directory=src/templates/amp

# the above is the same as
maizzle make:template amp-layout.html -d=src/layouts/amp

# paths can be relative to project root, i.e. one level above
maizzle make:template example.html -d=../parent-directory
```

### make:tailwind

```bash
maizzle make:tailwind
```

Scaffolds a new Tailwind CSS config based on the one in the [Starter](https://github.com/maizzle/maizzle/blob/master/tailwind.config.js).

Running it with no arguments will present an interactive prompt that let's you specify the file name and destination directory.

You can skip the prompt by passing in arguments:

| Argument | Description
| --- | --- |
| `filename` | Name of the file to create, including extension, i.e. `twcustom.js`

| Option | Shorthand | Description
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--directory` | `-d` |  Directory where the config file should be output.

<alert>If the <code>--directory</code> path does not exist, it will be created.</alert>

<alert type="warning">If the resulting file already exists, Tailwind CSS config scaffolding will be aborted and an error will be thrown. The file will not be overwritten.</alert>

Examples:

```bash
# scaffold a Tailwind CSS config in the project root
maizzle make:tailwind twconfig.js

# use a custom directory (relative to project root)
maizzle make:tailwind twconfig.js --directory=config

# the above is the same as
maizzle make:tailwind twconfig.js -d=config

# place config one level above project root
maizzle make:tailwind twconfig.js -d=../global-configs
```
