# CLI commands

The CLI tool includes commands for scaffolding, developing, and building your emails.

## Development

CLI commands for developing emails with Maizzle.

### serve

```sh
maizzle serve
```

Use this command to develop emails locally.

A local development server is first created with BrowserSync, `maizzle build` is then called, and a directory listing is finally opened in your default browser ([configurable](/docs/browsersync/#open)). 

You can make changes to a file, save it, and the browser will automatically reload to reflect changes. And, of course, you can also [configure BrowserSync](/docs/browsersync/).

This command has the fastest build time, since most Transformers are disabled on purpose for local development, in the base `config.js`.

When developing locally, you have _all_ classes generated by Tailwind CSS at your disposal, so you can rapidly prototype and style emails, right in the browser.

### build

```bash
maizzle build [env?]
```

`maizzle build` is used to compile your templates and output them to the destination directory. If `[env]` is specified, Maizzle will try to compute an environment config by merging `config.[env].js` on top of the [default config](/docs/configuration/).

| Argument | Type | Required | Default | Description
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `[env]` | string | no |  `local` | An environment name to use

<alert>If no <code>[env]</code> is specified, Maizzle will default to <code>local</code> and use <code>config.js</code>.</alert>

## Scaffolding

CLI commands for creating new projects and scaffolding templates or configs.

### new

```bash
maizzle new [path?] [repo?] --no-deps?
```

The `new` command is used to scaffold and initialize a Maizzle project. 

It accepts two arguments, both optional:

| Argument | Type | Required | Default | Description
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `[path]` | string | no |  maizzle | Directory name to create project in
| `[repo]` | string | no |  <div class="w-32 break-words"><span>https:&zwnj;//github.com/maizzle/maizzle.git</span></div> | Git repository URL for a starter project

| Flag | Shorthand | Description
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--no-deps` | `-d` | Don't install NPM dependencies

Running it with no arguments (i.e. `maizzle new`) will:

1. Create a `maizzle` directory
2. Clone the `maizzle/maizzle` repo into it
3. Install the NPM dependencies

So you can basically clone any repo into any system path, which means you can use any starter project - not just ours - as long as you can clone it with Git.

Need to create a project based on a custom starter?

```bash
maizzle new https://github.com/maizzle/starter-amp4email.git
```

Want to use a different folder name than `starter-amp4email`?

```bash
maizzle new https://github.com/maizzle/starter-amp4email.git amp-emails
```

<alert>If the <code>[path]</code> directory already exists, scaffolding will be aborted.</alert>

<alert type="warning"><code>[repo]</code> must be a valid Git repository URL (.git extension included).</alert>

### make:config

```bash
maizzle make:config <env> --full?
```

Scaffolds a new `config.<env>.js` in the project root.

| Argument | Required | Default | Description
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<env>` | yes |  n/a | Environment name to use for the config

| Option | Shorthand | Description
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--full` | `-f` |  Output a full config

The `<env>` argument is an environment name, i.e. `staging`.

For example, let's scaffold `config.staging.js`:

```bash
maizzle make:config staging
```

By default, a minimal config is output, which only defines `build.destination.path`:

```js
module.exports = {
  build: {
    destination: {
      path: 'build_staging',
    },
  },
}
```

If you want a full config, use the `--full` option:

```bash
maizzle make:config staging --full
```

The full config is based on the Starter's [`config.js`](https://github.com/maizzle/maizzle/blob/master/config.js).

### make:layout

```bash
maizzle make:layout <filename> --directory?
```

Scaffolds a new Layout based on the [Starter's default Layout](https://github.com/maizzle/maizzle/blob/master/src/layouts/master.html). 

| Argument | Required | Default | Description
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<filename>` | yes |  n/a | Name of the file to create, including extension, i.e. `layout.html`

| Option | Shorthand | Description
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--directory` | `-d` |  Directory where Layout file should be output

<alert>If no <code>--directory</code> path is provided, Layout file will be output in <code>src/layouts</code> relative to where you executed the command.</alert>

<alert>If the <code>--directory</code> path does not exist, it will be created.</alert>

<alert type="warning">If the resulting file already exists, Layout scaffolding will be aborted and an error will be thrown. The file will not be overwritten.</alert>

Examples:

```bash
# scaffold a Layout in src/layouts
maizzle make:layout my-layout.html

# use a custom directory
maizzle make:layout amp-layout.html --directory=src/layouts/amp

# the above is the same as
maizzle make:layout amp-layout.html -d=src/layouts/amp

# paths can be relative to project root, i.e. one level above
maizzle make:layout master.html -d=../global-layouts
```

### make:template

```bash
maizzle make:template <filename> --directory?
```

Scaffolds a new Template.

| Argument | Required | Default | Description
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<filename>` | yes |  n/a | Name of the file to create, including extension, i.e. `template.html`

| Option | Shorthand | Description
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--directory` | `-d` |  Directory where Template file should be output

<alert>If no <code>--directory</code> is provided, Template file will be output in <code>src/templates</code> relative to where you executed the command.</alert>

<alert>If the <code>--directory</code> path does not exist, it will be created.</alert>

<alert type="warning">If the resulting file already exists, Template scaffolding will be aborted and an error will be thrown. The file will not be overwritten.</alert>
