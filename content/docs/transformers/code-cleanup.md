# Code Cleanup

Cleaning up your HTML email results in smaller file sizes, which translates to faster email sendouts, faster opens (think slow 3G), and snappier paint times.

Also, Gmail will clip your email [around 102KB](https://github.com/hteumeuleu/email-bugs/issues/41), so anything past that mark won't even be in the DOM (which can lead to unexpected results like tracking pixel not loaded or, worse, hidden unsubscribe links).

In email, bigger is never better. _Clean up your production emails._

---

These are the cleanup-related options in `config.js` :

```js
// config.js
module.exports = {
  purgeCSS: {},
  removeUnusedCSS: {},
  replaceStrings: {},
  removeAttributes: [],
  safeClassNames: {},
  sixHex: true
}
```

Let's go through each of those options.

## purgeCSS

You can configure CSS purging as long as you're not using Tailwind CSS JIT mode.

Add a `purgeCSS` key to your config, to customize PurgeCSS settings:

```js
module.exports = {
  purgeCSS: {
    defaultExtractor: content => {
      // return a custom extractor
    },
    content: [], // array of filenames or globs to scan for selectors
    safelist: [], // array of strings or custom object
    blocklist: [], // array of strings
  }
}
```

### defaultExtractor

If your CSS class names include characters not covered by [Tailwind's default extractor](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/blob/master/src/lib/purgeUnusedStyles.js#L25-L34), use this option to specify a custom one:

```js
module.exports = {
  purgeCSS: {
    defaultExtractor: content => [...myCustomExtractor(content)]
  }
}
```

<alert type="warning">Characters like <code>$</code> need to be escaped in CSS. This isn't well supported in email clients. When using class names with characters other than <code>:</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>./</code> and <code>%</code>, Maizzle will <a href="#safeclassnames">replace</a> some of them with safer alternatives.</alert>

### content

Use the `content` key to define _additional_ paths that the plugin should scan for CSS selectors - Maizzle already configures it with all your build source paths.

```js
module.exports = {
  purgeCSS: {
    content: ['/Code/emails/project/', 'src/archive/']
  }
}
```

### safelist

Use `safelist` to define an array of class names or patterns that you want preserved:

```js
module.exports = {
  purgeCSS: {
    safelist: ['wrapper', /red$/]
  }
}
```

In this example, the `.wrapper` selector as well as any selectors ending with 'red' such as `.bg-red` will be preserved in the final CSS.

For greater control over CSS purging, `safelist` can also be an object:

```js
safelist: {
  standard: [],
  deep: [],
  greedy: [],
  keyframes: [],
  variables: []
}
```

See the [PurgeCSS docs](https://purgecss.com/configuration.html#options) for an explanation of all options.

### blocklist

`blocklist` will prevent the CSS selectors from showing up in the compiled CSS. 
The selectors will be removed from your CSS _even if you use them and they are seen by PurgeCSS_.

```js
module.exports = {
  purgeCSS: {
    blocklist: ['wrapper', /^nav-/]
  }
}
```

In the example above, even if you use `.wrapper` or `.nav-links` anywhere in your templates, they will be removed from the compiled CSS.

<alert>Learn more about all these options, in the <a href="https://purgecss.com/configuration.html#options" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PurgeCSS docs &nearr;</a></alert>

## removeUnusedCSS

This is where you can configure the [email-comb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/email-comb) library. Options under `removeUnusedCSS` will be passed directly to it, to clean up your CSS.

Enable CSS cleanup:

```js
module.exports = {
  removeUnusedCSS: true,
}
```

Note that if you set `removeUnusedCSS` to an empty object, it won't work:

```js
module.exports = {
  // won't cleanup CSS, needs at least one option set
  removeUnusedCSS: {}
}
```

### whitelist

Array of classes or id's that you don't want removed. You can use all [matcher](https://www.npmjs.com/package/matcher) patterns.

```js
module.exports = {
  removeUnusedCSS: {
    whitelist: ['.External*', '.ReadMsgBody', '.yshortcuts', '.Mso*', '#*']
  }
}
```

<alert>Resetting email client styles is often done through CSS selectors that do not exist in your email's code - <code>whitelist</code> ensures these selectors are not removed.</alert>

### backend

If you use computed class names, like for example `class="{{ computedRed }} text-sm"`, the library will normally treat `{{` and `}}` as class names.

To prevent this from happening, set `backend` to an array of objects that define the start and end delimiters:

```js
module.exports = {
  removeUnusedCSS: {
    backend: [
      { heads: "{{", tails: "}}" }, 
      { heads: "{%", tails: "%}" }
    ]
  }
}
```

### removeHTMLComments

Set to `false` to prevent `email-comb` from removing `<!-- HTML comments -->`.

```js
module.exports = {
  removeUnusedCSS: {
    removeHTMLComments: false
  }
}
```

### removeCSSComments

Set to `false` to prevent `email-comb` from removing `/* CSS comments */`.

```js
module.exports = {
  removeUnusedCSS: {
    removeCSSComments: false
  }
}
```

<alert type="warning">If you have <a href="/docs/css-inlining/">CSS inlining</a> enabled, CSS comments will still be removed, even with <code>removeCSSComments</code> disabled here.</alert>

You can use the `data-embed` attribute on a `<style>` tag to disable inlining for CSS inside it, if you need to preserve CSS comments.

For example, MailChimp uses CSS comments to define styles that are editable in their email editor. Here's how you can preserve them:

1. Set `removeCSSComments: false` in your config, as above
2. Write your CSS with comments in a separate `<style>` tag:

```css
<style data-embed>
  /*
    @tab Page
    @section Body Background
    @tip Set the background colour for the email body.
  */
  .wrapper {
    /*@editable*/background-color: #EEEEEE !important;
  }
</style>
```

#### doNotRemoveHTMLCommentsWhoseOpeningTagContains

HTML email code often includes Outlook or IE conditional comments, which you probably want to preserve. If the opening tag of a conditional includes any of the strings you list here, `email-comb` will not remove that comment.

```js
module.exports = {
  removeUnusedCSS: {
    doNotRemoveHTMLCommentsWhoseOpeningTagContains: ['[if', '[endif']
  }
}
```

### uglifyClassNames

Set this to `true`, to rename all classes and id's in both your `<style>` tags and your body HTML elements, to be as few characters as possible.

Used in production, it will help trim down your HTML size.

```js
module.exports = {
  removeUnusedCSS: {
    uglifyClassNames: true
  }
}
```

## replaceStrings

Maizzle can batch replace strings in your HTML email template, and it even works with regular expressions!

Use the `replaceStrings` option to define key-value pairs of regular expressions and strings to replace them with:

```js
// config.production.js
module.exports = {
  replaceStrings: {
    'find and replace this exact string': 'with this one',
    '\\s?data-src=""': '', // remove empty data-src="" attributes
  }
}
```

<alert type="warning">Character classes need to be escaped when defining a regular expression for <code>replaceStrings</code>. As you can see above, <code>\s</code> becomes <code>\\s</code>.</alert>

`replaceStrings` is disabled by default, so that the function doesn't run and build time isn't unnecessarily affected.

## removeAttributes

Maizzle can remove attributes from your HTML after it compiles it.

```js
// config.js
module.exports = {
  removeAttributes: [
    {name: 'data-src'}, // remove empty data-src="" attributes
    {name: 'foo', value: 'bar'}, // remove all foo="bar" attributes
  ]
}
```

Internally, Maizzle uses this to remove any CSS inlining leftovers, like `style=""`.

## safeClassNames

[`posthtml-safe-class-names`](https://github.com/posthtml/posthtml-safe-class-names) is used to normalize `:` `/` `.` and `%` characters in your class names - these are the safe characters they are replaced with:


- `:` is replaced with `-`
- `\/` is replaced with `-`
- `%` is replaced with `pc`
- `.` is replaced with `_`

You can define new replacement mappings (or overwrite existing ones) by adding a `safeClassNames` key to your config.

For example, let's replace `:` with a `_` instead of the default `-`:

```js
// config.js
module.exports = {
  safeClassNames: {
    ':': '__'
  }
}
```

That would turn `sm:w-full` into `sm__w-full`.

You can prevent Maizzle from rewriting your class names with safe characters, by setting this option to `false`:

```js
module.exports = {
  safeClassNames: false
}
```

## Six-digit HEX

Ensures that all your HEX colors are defined with six digits - some email clients do not support 3-digit HEX colors, like `#fff`. Uses [color-shorthand-hex-to-six-digit &nearr;](https://www.npmjs.com/package/color-shorthand-hex-to-six-digit)

For better email client compatibility, this Transformer is enabled by default.

To disable it, simply set it to `false`:

```js
module.exports = {
  sixHex: false
}
```
