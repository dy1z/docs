# Code Cleanup

Cleaning up your HTML email results in smaller file sizes, which translates to faster email sendouts, faster opens (think slow 3G), and snappier time to interactive. 

Also, Gmail will clip your email [around 102KB](https://github.com/hteumeuleu/email-bugs/issues/41), so anything past that mark won't even be in the DOM (which can lead to unexpected results like tracking pixel not loaded or, worse, hidden unsubscribe links).

In email, bigger is never better. _Clean up your production emails._

These are the default settings in `config.js` :

```js
// config.js
module.exports = {
  cleanup: {
    purgeCSS: {
      content: [
        'src/layouts/**/*.*',
        'src/partials/**/*.*',
        'src/components/**/*.*',
      ],
      whitelist: [],
      whitelistPatterns: [],
    },
    removeUnusedCSS: {
      enabled: false,
    },
    keepOnlyAttributeSizes: {
      width: ['TABLE', 'TD', 'TH', 'IMG', 'VIDEO'],
      height: ['TABLE', 'TD', 'TH', 'IMG', 'VIDEO'],
    },
    preferBgColorAttribute: false,
    sixHex: false,
  },
  // ...
}
```

Let's go through each of those options.

## purgeCSS

When not developing locally, [postcss-purgecss](https://github.com/FullHuman/postcss-purgecss) is used to do a first pass over the compiled Tailwind CSS - this happens before CSS is injected into the HTML, so that tools like the Juice inliner or `email-comb` receive as little code to process as possible.

However, it can sometimes happen that it purges classes that you actually need - for example, if you have dynamic classes that you reference in HTML like this:

```handlebars
<div class="text-{{ computedTextSizeName }}">...</div>
``` 

To give you control, Maizzle exposes some of its options to your cleanup config:

```js
cleanup: {
  purgeCSS: {
    content: [], // array of filenames or globs to scan for selectors
    whitelist: [], // array of strings
    whitelistPatterns: [], // array of regular expressions
  }
  // ...
}
```

You can use the `content` key to define _additional_ paths that the plugin should scan for CSS selectors - Maizzle already configures it with all your build source paths.

Learn more about these options, in the [PostCSS Purgecss docs &nearr;](https://github.com/FullHuman/postcss-purgecss#options)

## removeUnusedCSS

This is where you can configure the [email-comb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/email-comb) library. Options under `removeUnusedCSS` will be passed directly to it, to clean up your CSS.

### enabled

Enables CSS cleanup through `email-comb`:

```js
cleanup: {
  removeUnusedCSS: {
    enabled: true,
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

### whitelist

Array of classes or id's that you don't want removed. You can use all [matcher](https://www.npmjs.com/package/matcher) patterns.

```js
cleanup: {
  removeUnusedCSS: {
    enabled: true,
    whitelist: ['.External*', '.ReadMsgBody', '.yshortcuts', '.Mso*', '#*'],
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

<div class="bg-gray-100 border-l-4 border-gradient-b-ocean-light p-4 mb-4 text-md" role="alert">
  <div class="text-gray-600">Resetting email client styles is often done through CSS selectors that do not exist in your email's code - <code class="shiki-inline">whitelist</code> ensures these selectors are not removed.</div>
</div>

### backend

If you use computed class names, like for example `class="{{ computedRed }} text-sm"`, the library will normally treat `{{` and `}}` as class names.

To prevent this from happening, set `backend` to an array of objects that define the start and end delimiters:

```js
cleanup: {
  removeUnusedCSS: {
    enabled: true,
    backend: [
      { heads: "{{", tails: "}}" }, 
      { heads: "{%", tails: "%}" }
    ],
    // ...
  },
  // ...
}
```

### removeHTMLComments

Set to `false`, to prevent `email-comb` from removing `<!-- HTML comments -->`.

```js
cleanup: {
  removeUnusedCSS: {
    enabled: true,
    removeHTMLComments: false,
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

<div class="bg-gray-100 border-l-4 border-gradient-b-ocean-light p-4 mb-4 text-md" role="alert">
  <div class="text-gray-600">ðŸ”¥ Adding comments for a colleague or client? Use <code class="shiki-inline">{# Nunjucks comments #}</code> - these are not rendered in the final, compiled email.</div>
</div>

#### doNotRemoveHTMLCommentsWhoseOpeningTagContains

HTML email code often includes Outlook or IE conditional comments, which you probably want to preserve. If the opening tag of a conditional includes any of the strings you list here, `email-comb` will not remove that comment.

```js
cleanup: {
  removeUnusedCSS: {
    enabled: true,
    doNotRemoveHTMLCommentsWhoseOpeningTagContains: ['[if', '[endif'],
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

### uglifyClassNames

Set this to `true`, to rename all classes and id's in both your `<style>` tags and your body HTML elements, to be as few characters as possible.

Used in production, it will help trim down your HTML size.

```js
cleanup: {
  removeUnusedCSS: {
    enabled: true,
    uglifyClassNames: true,
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

## keepOnlyAttributeSizes

Define for which elements should Maizzle only keep attribute sizes, like `width=""` and `height=""`. Elements in these arrays will have their inline CSS widths and heights removed.

Since most email clients support attribute sizes, the Starter config is set to remove inline CSS sizes for the following elements:

```js
cleanup: {
  keepOnlyAttributeSizes: {
    width: ['TABLE', 'TD', 'TH', 'IMG', 'VIDEO'],
    height: ['TABLE', 'TD', 'TH', 'IMG', 'VIDEO'],
  },
  // ...
}
```

## preferBgColorAttribute

The `bgcolor=""` attribute is well-supported by email clients. Set this to `true`, to remove any inlined `background-color` CSS properties:

```js
cleanup: {
  preferBgColorAttribute: true,
  // ...
}
```

## Six-digit HEX

Ensures that all your HEX colors are defined with six digits - some email clients do not support 3-digit HEX colors, like `#fff`. Uses [color-shorthand-hex-to-six-digit &nearr;](https://www.npmjs.com/package/color-shorthand-hex-to-six-digit)

<div class="bg-gray-100 border-l-4 border-gradient-b-ocean-light p-4 mb-4 text-md" role="alert">
  <div class="text-gray-600">For better email client compatibility, this transformer is always enabled.</div>
</div>
