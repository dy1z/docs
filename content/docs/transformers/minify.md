# Minify Email Code

Use the `minify` option to trim down the HTML size of your production emails. 

Minified email code weighs less in KB, resulting in faster sendouts, faster opens, and bandwidth savings on limited mobile data plans. Every little bit helps ðŸ™‚

Additionally, it reduces the risk of [Gmail clipping](https://github.com/hteumeuleu/email-bugs/issues/41).

Maizzle uses [html-crush](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-crush) and exposes its options to your config. 

Simply enabling it is enough to get you started with email-safe code minification:

```js
// config.production.js
module.exports = {
  minify: {
    enabled: true,
  },
}
```

Of course, you can customize the `html-crush` options:

```js
// config.production.js
module.exports = {
  minify: {
    enabled: true,
    lineLengthLimit: 500,
    removeIndentations: true,
    breakToTheLeftOf: [],
  },
}
```
